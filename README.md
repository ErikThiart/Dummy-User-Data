# Dummy-User-Data
A collection of dummy user data for development and testing

## Why

When developing an application, you would be wise to test it. You might test it for correctness and you might test it for load. Both of these situations benefit from having a large body of data that is semi-coherent (so you can kind of inspect it) at your disposal.

## Contribute

Feel free to push data to this repo, lets make it grow and become the defacto place for data that has been tested in a  real world enviroument.

Please feel free to add more quick recipes to test real applications with random data
